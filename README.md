# tess

Tess is a simple chess TUI that can also load puzzles from lichess.org. The main purpose of this software is:

1. To have a non-trivial program with which to benchmark and test LLM coding capabilities. In fact, tess is completely developed using LLMs such as OpenAI's o-series and Mistral Large models
2. To learn cell positions and PGN notation while solving puzzles :P

## Run

```
pip install python-chess
python tess.py simple.pgn
```
